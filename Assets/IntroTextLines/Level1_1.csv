Ouch, My Main Processing Unit hurts!
"Where am I? 
Who am I? 
And who are you?"
"Hm. My Hard Drive says, that my name is Cody. 
And you must be the player."
"Whereever I am, i need your help to get out of here.
Oh, dont worry, the difficulty parameters for this task are relatively low."
I can only do something, if my player gives me a script. 
"You will need administration access to my pool of rune stones. 
You will find those at the top of your screen."
Now, each of those contains one statement. An order, if you will.
To create a script, you must put those rune stones into the compilation list at the left side of the screen.
You can do that by dragging them there or by left shift + click on them. 
Also, you can move them around in the list and delete them by dragging them out or also left shift + click.
"If you order them from top to bottom and click on the compile button, 
i will execute one statement at a time, from top to bottom."
If you order them correctly, i may progress to the next stage. If not, i will have to start over.
Oh, by the way, if I am talking too much, you have permission to skip my lines by pressing space bar.
Now, if you would be so kind to help me through that door.
